* Got my Hugo blog site working with Github Pages
* Learned about Github Actions
* Published coding challenge project from a previous interview

## TIL
* Github Actions are workflows, processes, and CI steps baked into the Github ecosystem. You can utilize them by adding config files to a `.github/workflows` directory in your project, and the configured jobs will run when the specified actions happen (push to a specific branch, a PR is created, etc).

* Hugo uses a `baseURL` attribute from your `config.toml` file to build out absolute paths for assets. Mine was still set to the default (example.org) so my site was initially broken because it couldn't find the CSS files it needed, and the links were dead because example.org doesn't have my content.
